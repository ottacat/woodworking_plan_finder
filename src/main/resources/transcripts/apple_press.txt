my day started out like any other I was taking a nap Under The Apple Tree when all of a sudden I had an idea
I wondered if there was a way to make these apples into delicious apple cider
[Music]
so naturally I ran in the house grabbed a cup and started squeezing but that didn't really work out too well
but if at first you don't succeed grab a big old hammer and try again
but that was really messy and I really didn't get any juice so there was only
one thing left to try I called Craig who was an amazing golfer I figured if
anybody could help me out with my problem it would be him [Music]
but all that really did was get me all sticky and gross so I went into my
office and I got on the internet to do a little research and I actually found these old antique cider presses which
looked awesome basically they have this machine that chunks up the apples into a bucket you slide that forward and then
this whole pressing screw thing presses out the apples and the juice comes out the only problem is I need all these
metal Parts which I didn't have so I got on the internet and I searched metal Apple parts
and I found a bunch of weird watches so then I changed my search to metal
Apple Press Parts and I found more what I was looking for I actually found a
website called Happy Valley Ranch that sells all of the metal Parts I need to make my own press so let's quit talking
about it and let's go make a press [Music]
thank you now as far as I could tell in the pictures online the presses were made of
maple so that's what I got although I tasted it and it tasted nothing like
Maple yuck I grabbed a bunch of my 13 16 inch Maple and I carried it over to my
miter saw to start cutting it down into smaller more manageable pieces now the first thing we need to do is glue up
some big blocks of wood that we can use as the four legs of the press so I started ripping down my pieces of maple
into leg width pieces once I had enough pieces all cut down to make up my four
leg blanks I carried them over to my work table and now it was time to glue them all together now I figured I could
glue all these up at the same time as long as I didn't put glue in between the
individual leg glue UPS or else I'd have one giant leg instead of four individual
legs now this press will get a little wet you know apple juice so I decided to glue it
up using Titebond 3 which is rated for more outdoor use so I started spreading
and sprinkling Titebond 3 and every nook and cranny until I had glue squeezed in
between all four of my legs and I put them in clamps along with my leg blanks I glued up some
smaller blanks that I'll use for the stretcher pieces to connect the legs and create the base for my press now one of
the things I ordered from Happy Valley Ranch are these Barrel rings for lack of a better term they're basically the
rings that I'm going to use to create the barrels that'll catch all the apple bits and Bobs and well allow me to make
the juice there was just one problem if I cut straight pieces of wood well you can see I had a nice tight fit at the
front which I don't really want I want a little bit of a gap but they were too wide at the back to fit over the
pre-drilled holes so I went over to the table saw and after playing around with the angle a little bit I finally settled
on an angle of 12 degrees to cut on both sides of my piece I ran it through on
one side cut that angle flipped it around and cut it on the other side now if you're saying that piece looks a
little short don't worry this is just a scrap I'm just trying to figure things out at this point but now it's small
enough on the back to fit over the pre-drilled hole and still leave a little gap on the front for my juice to
run through happy with those angles I grabbed a bunch of scrap pieces of Maple and I
started cutting down just a zillion sticks with a 12 degree angle cut on
both sides once I had a bunch of pieces cut then I had to figure out how tall I
wanted each of my buckets to be I had no clue because I was basting this all off of a picture but if my eye is correct I
think it's right around a foot high so that's what I'm going with 12 inches so
after setting up a stop block on my miter saw I cut down 52 pieces at 12
inches in length that'll be 26 pieces per bucket which I know is the right
amount because that's how many holes are pre-drilled into each ring when it's all said and done it's going to look
something like this but this is hard maple which means I can't just sink a
screw into it without the maple cracking so I'm going to have to pre-drill every single piece twice once on the top and
once on the bottom so I set up this quick little jig just using some tape and a magnetic feather board from my
table saw this allowed me to drill a hole in the exact same place on each piece and in no time I had all 52 pieces
pre-drilled and I was ready for my favorite activity which was to hand sand each piece until I broke down all the
edges and they were nice and smooth but that didn't take too long because off camera I really made Craig do all
the sanding then all was left to do was to screw my individual Barrel staves to my little
metal Barrel Rings this took a while but it was really fun to see the barrel start to take shape I mean I know all I
did was cut a bunch of straight pieces of wood and screw them to some pre-made Barrel rings but still it's really
starting to look like something out of that picture on my computer I can taste that apple juice already
in no time I had not one but two barrels completely assembled and ready for the
Press ooh squish squish squish squish
trickle trickle trickle Yum Yum Yum yeah I think those are gonna work with those
done my glue up for my legs was dry so I went back over took it out of clamps and
persuaded each leg to come apart into its individual pieces now yes I am
marring up the legs pretty bad just whacking it with a chisel but I'm gonna plane all these down to their final
Dimension here in just a minute so don't get too cranky I also separated out my
littler blanks and then I took them over to the Joiner this allowed me to get two perfectly flat and square sides and then
after I was done with the jointer all I had to do was run them through the planer on the opposite sides and bring
them down to their final Dimension which was right around three and three quarters of an inch next I went over to
the miter saw and I chopped the ends off I didn't really need to do this because I didn't cut them to the right length
yet I just really wanted to make them look all pretty and they were beautiful hard maple
now here's one of the parts I got on the internet this is what's gonna hold the big screw turny wheel press thing that's
going to actually squish the apples and I have to mount that in between two of the legs so I took the dimensions off of
that piece of cast steel and I started marking out my legs so that I could add some recesses for that piece to sit as
well as the support to span the legs on the bottom now again I'm not sure of the
exact dimensions of anything because I'm basing this all off of what I saw online so every once in a while I had to kind
of hold the parts up to the legs and make sure everything was going to fit the way it should there basically needs
to be enough room underneath this metal piece to fit my bucket and still allow
it to sit on that lower support pretty confident that my measurements were somewhere in the ballpark I went over to
my dado saw and I started cutting some dados to hold everything together I
won't show you the entire process but believe me when I say there was a lot of back and forth and back and forth
testing the fit on parts and pieces taking a little bit more off testing it again taking a little bit more off
testing it again until I got everything to fit just right once I had that cast steel piece in the
top I could take my measurements on the bottom and cut that lower support piece is it casts steel or cast iron
I mean I know cast iron is what people usually say but I really think it's steel is there a difference between Iron
and Steel what do I know I'm a woodworker anyways it was back over to my dado saw to cut
more dados for that lower support now this is an antique design as far as I could tell with my research
on the internet presses like this have been around literally for hundreds of years so I thought it would be a shame
to use something like the Festool Domino Joiner to hook it together so I'm going with traditional you know
mortise and Tenon for lack of a better term it's just a open-ended mortise and
Tenon really just a giant dado that I shoved the full width of the leg into but
pretty soon I had my front leg all cut to the correct size and shape now on the bottom of these cast iron pieces are
these little indentations that's supposed to fit a support that'll run to
the back legs and hold up my Masher component so I measured off of those
front little recesses onto my back legs and I marked where I needed to put the supports on my back leg assembly
then it was once again back over to the dado saw to remove a bunch more material
so that I had a place for my back leg supports to recess into the legs once I
had everything cut out and fitting nice and snug I could cut those back leg supports to the right size so that my
back legs were exactly the same width as the span of my front legs here's where
it started to get a little complicated because I'm just guessing on a lot of this I'm pretty sure that these notches
have to be level with the top of my back brace piece so that the supports can be
recessed into that back brace piece and still fit under that front steel piece
so I have to cut some more dados in that upper support on the back and I have to
cut some pieces that are going to fit inside that steel and recess into that back support
did any of that make any sense it'll all make sense in a second when you actually see it in an effort to reduce the amount
of glue UPS I had to do I decided to use this 10 quarter Maple for all my support bracing so I did a little zip I did a
little zap I did a little Zoop and I did a little more zipping and pretty soon I
had some pieces milled up that should fit right underneath this steel piece
eventually they'll get bolted to that steel piece and they'll connect the front leg assembly to the back leg
assembly I also decided to add a stretcher on the lower leg supports to
really triangulate the support on the entire thing and make it as sturdy as possible so I marked out where I needed
to cut dados on all my connecting pieces went back over to the dado saw and I was
finally ready to start gluing everything together I think
but what do I know now to glue everything together I decided to take it
up a notch and use something really sturdy and by that I mean total boat fixo my thought process was if this
stuff's good enough for water it's got to be good enough for apple juice so I locked in a canister and started
squirting it and all my cracks and crevices on the Apple press
pretty soon I had my front leg assembly all put together with fixo and I stuck
some clamps on it and then well then I just set it aside
I went through the exact same process with the back leg assembly the only difference was it had a upper and lower
support because it didn't have that cast steel piece so once I got that all thick sewed up and put in clamps I set that
aside and now I just had to wait for them to dry but not being one to stand around with
my hands in my pockets I decided while I waited for those to dry I needed to build some sort of tray on the lower
section of my press to catch all the juice so I measured the distance between my legs on my leg assembly then I went
over to the table saw and ripped down a bunch of maple then I went back over and I measured the distance between my legs
on my leg assembly because I'd already forgotten from when I measured the first time
then it was over to the miter saw to start cutting down pieces again I don't know what I'm doing so I'm kind of
making this part up as I go along but all I really needed was a tray that
would hold these two buckets and hold juice at least I think that's all I need so
using the buckets as a reference I started cutting the pieces to what I thought was the right size and shape and
laying them out for assembly on my outfeed table but then I realized that a square end to
this tray might not be the best design looking at the pictures online the lower
tray always comes to almost a point and my guess is that's so that the juice can
be directed to a central hole that then drains out into some sort of collection device so I started chopping up the
front of my tray and making it more angular hopefully this will help direct
the juice to the right spot but now that I have all these weird angles cut I had another problem how the
heck am I going to join these together they're too weird to really get a domino Joiner on there and I already said I
didn't want to use dominoes because this is kind of an antique project so I opted for splines now if you've
never used splines to connect weird angles like this it's pretty darn easy I just drew a line where I wanted my
spline to be I set my fence and my table saw blade height and I very carefully
ran the pieces through the table saw now these are just test pieces to see if it'll work now I have this nice line
that connects one angle to the other and all I have to do is fill that with a piece of wood or a spline pretty happy
with my blade height and distance away from the fence I took all of my pieces over and I started very carefully
running them through that blade as you can see you got some awkward cuts that you have to make doing it this way but
as long as you go slow I'm convinced you can still do it safe and accurately
with all the mortises cut for my splines now all I have to do is cut the splines themselves and insert them into the
holes since the splines are going to be visible I thought it would be cool to use a contrasting wood color and I had
this piece of mahogany laying around so after resawing it down so it was a little thinner on the bandsaw I took it
over to the planer and I thinned it down even more now these have to be a precise thickness so I finished it off on the
drum sander making little pass by little pass until I had a nice tight fit in my
pre-cut grooves on my pieces the nice thing about splines is not only will
they add a ton of strength to your joint they'll also help with alignment so that when you go to clamp this joint up it's
not going to be slipping and sliding all over the place I test fit the splines into their
grooves and they fit perfect but before I glued up the front end I thought I
might as well get the back end glued up so it wasn't flopping all over the place while I was trying to deal with those
angles at the front now the back is a lot easier because it's just some butt joints
I figured the strongest way to hook these pieces together would be screws but I drilled some holes so that I can
fill those holes with plugs later that I'll make out of mahogany and it'll match the splines on the front so with
those holes drilled I added some thick so in between my butt joint and I clamped the whole thing together after
pre-drilling I screwed it in place and pretty soon the back end was all locked
and loaded and ready to go time to assemble that front end now normally
gluing and clamping angles like this is a total pain because they don't want to stay put but as I mentioned before the
splines make all that go away because once you insert the spline into its hole it kind of locks the whole thing
together and it can't slip and slide around which is really nice pretty soon I had splines and all the
joints and all I had to do was clamp it up with that and clamps I decided to cut
some plugs to fill those screw holes I'm going to be using the CMT plug cutter I
have these available for sale on my website and they work fantastic there's a link Down Below in the video
description I just grabbed another scrap piece of mahogany and started plugging away
literally after I had the plugs cut out with a plug cutter I went over to the bandsaw and I freed them from their
holes so that I could permanently glue them in another hole Port plugs
I was on a thick sew kick so why not just keep it up I smeared a little thick so on the end of each plug inserted into
the hole and I tap tap taparoo with the hammer I'll come back and flush cut
these later and you'll never know there's screws under there feel like I'm getting older I wake up in
the morning my body's sore it's harder to get out of bed and I have to be more responsible apparently you got to do

with my juice tray well underway I had to tackle another juice flow issue now
if these buckets sit right on the bottom of the tray it's going to make it harder for that juice to flow so I need a tray
that sits on top of the tray so that the bucket can sit on that
if that makes any sense so using my buckets as a size reference I cut down a bunch of pieces of hard
maple about a half inch thick and three quarter inch wide and then I cut down a bunch of little spacer pieces about an
eighth of an inch wide so that I could space out all my half inch pieces and you know make them look nice and uniform
I also clamped a nice straight edge on the front of my outfeed table so that I could assemble everything against that
and make sure it was all lined up nice and pretty to hook these together I'm going super
simple I cut a few support pieces to put Crossways on the bottom and I added a
little type on three and I mean a little just a dollop of glue on each individual
slat then I set that support piece on top and I just added a staple in each slat
to hold my support piece firmly on there I figured between that and the glue it's
got a pretty good chance of surviving against the onslaught of apple juice which is in its future
I added three supports on the bottom of each tray I think those should be plenty strong and it should raise those buckets
off of my lower tray enough to allow that juice to flow freely now because I made two buckets I did have to make two
trays and I quickly realized that square trays just weren't gonna work because the front of my lower tray has that
angled nose so I took my other trays over to my first tray and I used that as
a reference to Mark where I needed to cut my second Trace trivets whatever you want to call these
things and now they should fit nicely under my buckets and in that lower tray
by that time my leg assembly was all dry and ready to be taken out of clamps so I
removed the clamps and I gave it a nice sanding to get rid of any extra thick so that I had accidentally smeared on the
outside my lower juice tray was also dry so I took that out of clamps I flush trimmed
and sanded all of those plugs and now I was ready to start thinking about hooking my back leg assembly to my front
leg assembly now I had to wait until this lower tray was done because I needed to be able to use it as a size
reference and space out those legs accordingly so I just set my lower stretcher in place and I set the outer
frame of my lower tray in place as well as these little trivets I made hey
trays and trivets that's all to find the two next I set my buckets on top of my
trivets inside of my tray and this allowed me to figure out how far out I
needed to space the back and front leg assembly you see the front leg has to be right above this bucket so that the
Smasher thing works and then the back legs well they have to be able to hold these supports and also hold the apple
eater which is this thing at least I just like to call it the apple eater because it's
supposed to smash up and well eat the apples before they get pressed there is
a slight issue when I went to set the apple eater in as you can see it needs to be resting on those supports up by
that axle so I had to carve out a little bit of material so that it would sit down in between those so I took the
supports off went back over to the dado saw a little zip a little zap a little Zoop I removed some material stuck those
support pieces back in place and now if all goes well my apple eater should fit where it's supposed to
which I'm happy to report it did so with everything where it should be
generally and the front legs and the back legs spaced out correctly for the
buckets and the tray down below I marked where everything was supposed to go now
all the metal pieces are going to be bolted in place so I had a mark where I needed to pre-drill holes to accommodate
those bolts so I did that on the top and on the bottom and the sides and the front and the back there's a lot of
places to Mark once I had everything marked I took apart all the supports I went over to my drill press and I
pre-drilled all of those holes so that I should be able to slide bolts in there later the only part that I couldn't fit
inside the drill press was the bolts that are going to go through the side of the legs to hold that front press
assembly so I just did that by hand but it wasn't too bad then it was time to squirt on
some more thick so and actually glue the front leg assembly to the back leg assembly with those connecting support
pieces while I waited for all of that to dry I decided to address a major design flaw
that I noticed with my lower tray there's a giant hole in it all the juice
is just gonna leak out onto the floor so I had to add a bottom to my tray I went
over to my router table and using a bits and bits Astra coated rabbeting bit I
rabbeted a nice three-quarter inch deep by half inch rabbet around the bottom
side of my tray it looked something like this with my rabbit cut I took the
measurements both for length and width and then I went over to the table saw and I cut down a three-quarter inch
thick piece of Baltic birch plywood yes plywood because well it's easy
and well I had some plywood over in the corner and I thought oh that'll work so
I grabbed it then I set the tray frame on top of the piece of plywood I traced
out the shape of that rabbet that I just cut and using a combination of the miter saw and my oscillating belt sander I
shaped that lower piece to the right shape so that it would slide into that tray assembly but before I did that I
gooped up that whole inner lip with some thick sew now this is both to glue that plywood base in place and also seal up
that plywood Edge so that it doesn't get exposed to moisture and make that plywood want to start popping apart so
using an ample amount of thick so on that Groove I slid the plywood in and
then just to be safe I added a nice little bead of thick so around the inside so that juice can't run down into
that crack and mess with the plywood is this Overkill probably but better
safe than sorry am I right and because I'm using the Fast cure
thick so by the time I was done with the tray base my glue was dry on my leg assembly so I could go over there and
start actually bolting on all my metal parts and pieces so using a hammer for a
little persuasion yes I did put a giant dent on the side of my leg sorry I was able to get all of my metal pieces
bolted on and tightened down now this is where I started to go a
little rogue the original design for this apple eater is to put this giant
wheel on the end you spin the wheel around it rotates the Apple eating device and it crushes your apples
but that just seemed like so much work and I'm lazy so I decided to take this
wheel off and then I just happened to have this little AC motor laying around I figured why not hook this up with a
belt to the apple eater and just make it do all the work and I actually found a
conversion kit to do this on the same website I bought all the metal pieces from for the Press so I bought this
little wheel and I was almost ready to rock and roll there was only one problem the motor I had spun in the wrong
direction so after doing a little bit of research on YouTube I just took the
motor apart rewired it switched a few leads around and reversed the direction of the motor until it was moving in the
right direction for my setup and hopefully can turn the wheel the way that I want it to go
there's also a little issue of where to mount the motor because if I mounted it back here this belt was gonna rub but I
really didn't want to mount it off the side so all I had to do was raise the motor up a little bit so I milled up a
piece of that 10 quarter Maple and I thought if I just glued this on the back and set the motor on top that should
give me enough clearance for that belt to move freely which it did but obviously before I hook any of this in
place there's a few more things I needed to do like cut these long support pieces
to length why I didn't cut these to length before I glued them in there I'm not quite sure I just didn't
so a little Zip Zap soup with the hand saw and they were ta-da cut to the right
length same thing on that bottom support just cut it to the right size before you
glue it up silly with those cut to the right length I smeared on yet more thick so and I glued
on my little block for my motor to sit on and then I discovered another issue
at this point my lower tray is level which means that there's not going to be any flow for that juice to come towards
the front so I had to figure out some way to raise the tray up in the back so that the juice would actually flow
forward so I cut this little tiny wedge out of some scrap maple and I thought if
I just stick this wedge under here like this and glue it down like that then I
can use that to determine the direction of the tray and all I'll have to do is Bolt it in in the back and I'll have
some nice slope towards the front now it's really important that that front is in perfect contact with my
support because there's going to be a ton of weight coming down from the Press hence the need for the wedge I couldn't
just have a little Gap under there or it might blow out the plywood so I squirted some more thick so on I
stuck my wedge in place and I clamped it down now while I was on the internet looking for the conversion kit to turn
this into a motorized app leader I saw that they sell these little bearings that go on the outside of this axle I
thought that was probably a good idea considering this thing's going to be spinning a lot faster than normal so I
made some little blocks and a place for those to be attached but before I attached them I had to finish this
entire thing and by finish I mean actually put a coat of finish on it not
complete it now this thing is going to be used to make apple juice which is going to go inside my body so I didn't
want to use some toxic finish that wasn't food safe so I opted for just plain Jane mineral oil because mineral
oil is safe to consume they actually prescribe it as a laxative in case you wanted to know so I loaded
up a spray bottle with a bunch of mineral oil and I coated my floor with sawdust not because I'm crazy because I
didn't want to get my floral oil oily and the sawdust worked just as well as a drop cloth
then I just started spritzing the entire thing with a heavy layer of mineral oil letting it soak in spritzing it a little
more letting it soak in and then spritzing it a little more pretty soon I
had the entire thing coated in an ample amount of mineral oil and I was finally ready to assemble it
so I grabbed this big press screw component and I threaded it into place
and that's when I realized this thing's really hard to turn because it's so dinky and Tiny look at this and that's
when I had an idea because I wasn't going to use this giant wheel to turn the apple eater I thought what if I
somehow hook this onto this thingymabob and make it a lot easier to turn around
so I just clamped it on top and then because this is cast steel it's actually fairly soft
so I was able to drill holes through the wheel and through the top of that twisty turny thing and just bolt it in place
easy peasy Apple squeezy the wheel even came with this Maple
handle which made turning it that much easier I think I'm really up to something here people are going to start
doing this I may have just reinvented the wheel on the Apple press
with that attached I bolted my little motor in place and because I didn't need this extra length sticking out on this
little axle I just cut it off with my reciprocating saw filed it down a little bit so it wasn't sharp and that motor
looks like it was always meant to be there I raised up the back end of my tray to
get that nice slope that I was talking about drilled some countersunk holes and added some stainless steel fasteners to
secure it in place I did the same thing at the front this time on the base of the tray and I added
a little thick so to those holes before I inserted the Fasteners just to make sure that no juice was gonna leak out
speaking of juice leaking out I almost forgot to drill a hole at the front of
the tray so that the juice could actually leak out so I drilled one with
a forstner bit coming in from both sides so I wouldn't have any blowout and then I added a little thick so around the
inside of that hole to seal off that exposed plywood I also made this little
round thing to go into the Masher but I forgot to film that part now this might be Overkill but I did add
stainless steel lag screws through all those joints just to make extra sure that this thing was Rock Solid and not
going anywhere and then the final thing I did was add these workbench removable casters that would allow the thing to be
raised and lowered if you needed to move it around and with that
the Apple press was done pretty impressive
if you know what I mean there was really just one thing left to do and that was to test it out and see
if it'd work so I walked out the door of my shop and over to our apple trees and me and Craig
started picking and picking and when I say we picked a
lot of apples I mean well we picked a lot of apples
like a ton of apples like a ridiculous amount of apples were
picked because if you're gonna do a thing you might as well really do a thing
so I brought the Apple press out I lowered it down it was nice and sturdy and we got to work I was really curious
to see if my electric apple eater would work the way that it's supposed to oh my
gosh this thing's awesome it literally
destroys apples foreign Tek
so let me break it down for you you feed apples in the apple eater as fast as you can it eats them up and spits them down
into the bucket below and a bunch of mush that's ready to be pressed once you get enough apples in the bucket to fill
it up you slide the bucket forward underneath the actual pressing device then you stick in this little wooden
topper so you get a nice even press and you crank the press down until it starts
creating pressure and the apple juice starts blowing out liquid gold look at
all that deliciousness and then you just keep doing this over and over again until you got a good amount of apple
cider while it's pressing in the front you can be crushing apples in the back you know for productivity
and I have to say if you've never had cider straight out of an apple press well you're missing out because this
stuff is pretty darn delicious I like to use a mixture of apples different kinds
and I got a couple pear trees so we just threw those in as well it really didn't take that long to start raking in the
apple cider in no time we had 25 gallons of it and for those of you wondering
what I did with all the leftover apple pulp don't worry it didn't go to waste I
just wheeled it over to my neighbor's cows dumped it in the field and they were very happy to have the little treat
they just weren't very happy that I was in their pasture
[Music]
oh hi hey look we did it 25 gallons of
cider in like two and a half hours that's pretty darn good with a little
press I threw together in my shop I'm pretty happy with how it turned out I can see myself pressing apples well
into my 60s drinking them too and if I'm drinking that much apple juice well I'm probably
going to live to be like 150. that's a lot more pressing anyways hope
you enjoyed that video check out all the links down in the video description to um all the parts and pieces we used you
can basically click on those links and build your own press with everything that's down there also there's a link to our patreon page there's a link to our
website if you want some sweet new merch or Plans by the way we do have plans available for this press down there
somewhere so give it a cruise and tune in next time for another video maybe
we'll press grapes for bananas ooh
