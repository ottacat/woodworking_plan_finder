wasn't falling on the ground he was just always in my way so after much deliberation I got on SketchUp and I
designed this desk and we started working on it first thing I did was cut out some templates so I could get the
shape of my legs right I traced out the templates onto Some solid stock of wood I cut out those rough shapes and it was
looking pretty good then I took everything over to the router table and using a pattern routing bit I routed
everything out until it was the perfect shape and then I started laying out all my desk parts once I had all the parts
laid out for the front frame of my desk I glued them together with some dominoes and then I glued up my top
[Music] and after that I glued up a back frame section with both of these frame
sections done it was starting to look somewhat like a desk but we wanted to make it prettier so I got out a round
over bit and I rounded over everything so that it'd look more mid-century than
using some dominoes I glued my front section and my back section together with some cross brace pieces and we had
a frame for a desk then because I didn't want to do it I made Craig put finish Rubio monocoat on the top and the desk
base and that's where we left off a beautiful desk frame now to complete the
project [Music]
Building the Drawers
thank you now as nice as the desk frame looked it was missing something drawers now these
drawers are going to be a little unique because they're not actually built into the desk itself they're going to be a
floating separate drawer box that slides into these openings and to secure to the
few screws so we got to build some drawer box
things for lack of a better word now I didn't want to just build some square boxes and shove them in there I wanted
them to have some shapes some roundness to match the desk so I started with some thick six quarters solid black walnut
and I will shape this into you know a round box rather than your traditional
square box along with the six quarter black walnut I also milled up some 13 16
black walnut that will be used for the top and the bottom of our box because I don't need those to be thick
that's why I used thinner wood because you shouldn't use thicker wood when you
want something thin you should use thin wood effect once I got a straight edge on all my
boards I took them over to the table saw and I ripped them down to the correct width now the plan is to glue up two big
chunks one of six quarter black walnut and one of the 13 16. they'll be long
straight pieces that I can then dice up into my individual sides and tops and bottoms for my two separate drawer box
units so after cutting everything to width on the table saw I went over to the planer and we ran everything through
the planer on both sides to get the tops and bottoms nice and smooth with two
pieces of six quarter and two pieces of 13 16 Walnut all I had to do now was
spread some glue on that seam using my patented glue spreading device
and then stick them in clamps I'm not going to be using any biscuits or dominoes to hook this together because
it's only two pieces and it shouldn't be that bad I was able to get the seams pretty nice and even and the little bit
of Ridge that is there I'll just sand out later with the Rotex after I got my two pieces of six quarter Walnut glued
up now it was time to glue up my two pieces of 13 16. now the width on this
is only 14 inches which means I don't have to be that careful gluing it together because after I'm done I can
just run it back through the planer and get rid of any unevenness that may have occurred once the glue is dry I took all
the clamps off and I had a little cleanup to do as far as the glue goes so
I got out a putty knife and I scraped off all the excess glue before I took it
over to my planer once the glue was off well I mean I already said it twice I
took it over to my planer that part should have been pretty darn obvious I
mean the lead up was a dead giveaway now unfortunately I couldn't plane down the six quarter Walnut because it was
too wide for my planer so after looking around and realizing that Craig was nowhere to be found I had to sand this
one myself luckily the Rotex eats through those seams and makes it nice
and smooth in no time now here's where I had a little bit of add which I do quite
often in the shop I started cutting up all the pieces because I fully intended to start working on the drawer boxes
themselves I immediately got distracted and decided that instead of doing that boring work I thought it would be fun to
design some new wood drawer pulls to go on the front of the drawers themselves now I just kind of made these up as I
went along so I'm going to try and lay it out for you exactly as I did it the first thing I did was rip down a strip
of two inch wide by three quarter inch thick black walnut then I went over to
my miter saw and I cut it up into 12 inch sections now I'm going to need four
individual drawer pulls so I went ahead and cut up six sections because I didn't
know what I was doing yet and I thought there'd be a really good chance I'd mess something up along the way and I wanted
to have a few extras next I took my two inch wide blanks and
I marked the very center of each of them so right at one inch and I drew a line
right down the middle dividing it in two then I measured over from the right hand
corner four inches and I made a little Mark now here's where you just got to be creative I needed a round radius profile
so I just grabbed the top to a jar of dowels I had laying around and I used it
to trace out a quarter Circle starting at that point four inches in from the edge and ending at that line right in
the center now because I'm going to have drawer pulls on either side of the desk some of them have to be facing One
Direction and some have to be facing the other direction so for three of my six pieces I marked them on one side and for
three I marked on the opposite side same marks opposite sides of the board then I
went over to the bandsaw and I cut right along that center line all the way to
just where my line started to curve and then I stopped because we're not going
to cut that curve yet first we're going to cut straight lines on all of our pieces and and then we'll move the fence
and then we'll cut that curve so that's how I did it
after all my straight lines were cut I cut the curve but I didn't cut right to the line because I was worried I wasn't
going to hit it exact so I left a little meat on that bone just on the other side
of the line and we'll come back and clean this up later with the oscillating belt sander and by later I mean we're
going to do that right now because this is a YouTube video and I really don't see any sense in making you wait so
after I got all my curves cut I went over to my oscillating belt sander and
very carefully I sanded right up to the line and made sure the transition from my straight line to my curve was nice
and flowy like one continuous Arc now if you have no idea how in the world
this is going to become a drawer pull well don't worry neither did I at this point like I said I was making this up
as I went along next I went back over to my outfeed table and using my ruler I
marked three inches over this time from the left hand side and I made a little
Mark then I did the same thing on all of my pieces reversing that measurement for
the pieces that were going the opposite direction so now we have three pieces going one way and three pieces going the
other way and they're all cut out with a little straight section and a nice little curve next I chalked up a one
Adding a Cove
inch Cove bit into my router table and I'm going to use this to add a Cove on
the underside of that piece this is where our fingers are going to be able to catch and actually use it as a pull
to pull the drawer out as you can see this looks a little sketchy but I
promise it's not you just want to make sure that you're going with the grain and that you're just taking off a little
bit at a time working your way down to that final depth this is also why I cut
these things so long they're 12 inches I don't need 12 inches but I wanted a little room on either side that I could
hold on to so that my fingers would not be anywhere near that spinning router bit
pretty soon I had a nice Cove cut on the bottom I went right up to that line that I marked over three inches and then I
stopped right at the apex of the curve on the other side so those are my two guides to know where I needed to place
that Cove again don't try and take off all the material with one pass start
with little passes like an eighth of an inch at a time and work your way down to the final depth until that bearing is
resting on your piece if you take off too much at once that's when things get a little scary with the cove for our
fingers cut now it was time to start actually shaping the piece so I set the
table saw to 20 degrees and I ran all the pieces through cutting off just the top corner of our handle above where we
just coved so it kind of looks something like that after running all my pieces
through it 20 degrees I set the saw to 45 degrees and I ran them through again
what we're doing here is starting to get a nice round-ish shape on the top of our
drawer pull we'll refine this a little bit later on over again on the sander but for now we're just removing material
then I went over to the miter saw I set my saw to 40 degrees and we're going to
cut an angle ending right at the tip of that curve that we cut over on the
bandsaw now this isn't a compound angle I don't have the saw blade tilted on the
opposite axis I'm just cutting a straight down 40 degree right to the tip
of that curve so it looks something like this then I got a three quarter inch setup block these are Rockler set up
blocks they're awesome because they're same dimension on all four sides and I marked over three quarters of an inch
from that line that we marked earlier the one that was three inches in from the side
once I've marked all my pieces over three quarters of an inch I take them back over to the miter saw and I cut
another 40 degree angle matching my previous one this time on the opposite
end it's really funny when you film yourself making something up and then you go back and you voice it over as if
you know what you're doing because in my head at this point I'm just cutting angles and hoping it looks good anyways
now we've got matching angles on both sides and it's starting to take shape of course you have to do opposite angles on
your other three pieces that are going the other direction but that's not too hard to figure out now after I had all
those angles cut I decided that I wanted to start rounding these over a little bit but I didn't want to do it all by
hand so I set the saw to 30 degrees I believe and I just cut a little bit off
the top leaving about a quarter of an inch on the bottom of straight grain cut
from our initial 40 degree cut if that makes any sense at all after I
Making Drawer Pulls
cut that angle on the little side I switch the saw over and I cut that same
angle on the bigger side again just working our way slowly down to our final
thickness you don't want to take too much off at once I didn't measure these I just completely eyeballed it until I
was close to a quarter of an inch at the bottom there and it's starting to look
kind of drawer pull-esque I think pretty
soon I had all six of my drawer pulls roughly shaped as you can see three
facing One Direction and three facing the other direction now you really could
stop here if you wanted more of a flat faceted look for your drawer pull but I wanted them to be a little more round to
match the desk itself so I went over to the sander and just by hand I rocked the
pieces back and forth across the sanding belt to knock down all the ridges that we created on the table saw and give
everything a nice rounded overlook there's really no wrong way to do this I
mean these are custom drawer pulls whatever shape you want is fine just keep sanding and shaping until it looks
good to you because that's really all that matters unless of course you're building this for your wife then
definitely double check with her before making any design decisions before long I had all the ridges knocked down and
everything was looking sexy and smooth and almost like I had known what I was
doing from the very beginning I just touched up all of my edges with a little hand sanding starting at 120 and working
my way up to 180 and the shaping portion of making the drawer pulls was done now
to figure out a way to attach them to the drawer faces I made this little jig with two holes in it that landed right
on the big flat Parts on the back side of the pole then I use this little
automatic punch yes it's available on my website for purchase and I made a little
Mark right where I wanted to drill my holes on the back of the pole then
leaving it in this Rockler wood screw clamp so that I'd have a nice steady surface I very carefully drilled out a
hole on either side of the pole making sure not to go too deep and poke out the
front of the pole and have to start all over again which thankfully I didn't
as I set the stop on my drill press with our holes drilled out all I had to
do now was just add a drop of CA glue inside the hole and then I cut some
lengths of threaded Rod I chalked it up into a drill and very carefully I used
the drill to thread the rod into our hole and glue itself in place with that CA glue once I started to get resistance
which meant I was deep enough I unshucked the threaded rod from the drill and look at that now we have a way
to install these onto the drawer faces all we have to do is drill corresponding sized holes through our drawer face
we'll stick this drawer pole through the holes and we'll attach it from the back side with a few locking nuts
shoe that took a while I almost forgot what we're even working on
oh yeah desk [Music]
Squarespace
dude what the heck are you doing I'm doing a little Tick Tock dance because I got these hats and I'm trying to do the
tick tock thing and make people all want them why don't you just make a Squarespace
website and then you just send people there they can find your products and you can do this
on your own platform but you see sometimes I have to edit my videos to
make myself look a little nicer so I need a platform that I can do that on you have a Squarespace has the video
studio app where you can make professional level videos right there in the app edit post all that stuff
you don't say give me what if I want to save my videos so people can see them
for a long time like create a little gallery I don't know why anyone want to see this
again but Squarespace does have a portfolio and gallery page so you can
present your work in a professional manner not like this by creating a nice
looking portfolio of all your stuff all right what if I don't want to
go to the post office because I'm too busy dancing and I want people to come right to me to pick up their hats so I
don't have to ship them well through Squarespace you don't have
to just ship products you can easily offer local pickups so people can come to you
you have more time to move around oh
that would be nice listen just go to squarespace.com and
start a free trial and when you're ready to launch go to squarespace.com bergenboth Woodworking and you get 10
off your first purchase of a website or domain I guess I'll look into it

Drawer Boxes
anywho with our drawer polls done and out of the way it was finally time for
my add to be put aside and get back to work on the drawer boxes the thing that
we actually need to get done so back over to that slab of six quarter Walnut and I started cutting it into rough
lengths I say rough lengths because I didn't trust the accuracy to get all of
my pieces cut with the track saw so I just cut them roughly to length and then I went over and I cut them exactly the
right length on the table saw now as I mentioned at the beginning of the video I didn't just want square boxes I wanted
them to be slightly round in shapes that had match the rest of the desk so I'm going to round over all the corners of
the box but I want a big round over big enough that I didn't want to start with
that big of a round over so first I hit it with a half inch round over and the little trim router and then I chalked up
this gigantic one inch round over over on my router table and I ran all my
pieces through that this is a big guy and it scares me a little bit but look at that round over
is a nice curve oh I like that so anyways I did that to all the edges of
the sides of my box pretty soon I had all my pieces cut and rounded over and
it's gonna look a little something like this wait for it hold on fat fingers McGee
over here is trying to do stuff one side two sides and three sides now
you might be saying doesn't a box have four sides well yeah but this is a box
for drawers so the drawers are gonna be the front side so we gotta leave that
open now I didn't think I needed any biscuits or dominoes to glue this up because it's long grain the long grain
so as long as I could get some clamps on there and let it dry adequately this thing should have no problem sticking
together so I just smeared glue on both of my edges I wedged it between my
rounded over side pieces and I hooked on a few clamps now because there was no
front to these boxes when I started clamping the back it kind of wanted to pinch that front together so in order to
keep this from happening and make sure that the Box remained Square I cut these little brace pieces to wedge in the
front while I had the back clamped and waited for the glue to dry it worked pretty good and in no time I had both my
separate drawer boxes well um started at least we still got a long
ways to go before these puppies are done so after waiting for my glue to dry I removed the clamps and I started
refining the curve of the Box using the hand sander now you don't want to focus
on one spot for too long with the hand sander or you'll get a flat spot it's
all about keeping the sander in constant motion and working your way around that curve mimicking the shape really
bringing it to life ah yeah
once I had those all sanded it was time to start figuring out my top and bottom
using this 13 16 Walnut we glued up earlier so I set my
drawer box component on top of my Walnut slab and I used it to Mark out the
length that I would need for a top and bottom section once I had that marked out I just used the track saw and I cut
it a little bit longer than I actually needed it because that will make gluing
it on the top and bottom so much easier once I had my pieces cut I set my drawer
box Contraption on one of the bottom pieces and then I plopped on a top piece
now you might be asking how are you planning on hooking these to your side
pieces well I'm glad you asked because I wanted to disappoint you and tell you
that I'll just be using the Domino Joiner now you might also be asking isn't that
going to be a problem you know wood movement at all and I don't think it will be these pieces are small enough
that they're really not going to move that much and I've actually done this exact same method when I built my
whiskey coffee table over a year ago and it still looks great if you're interested in that video you
can click that thing or right up there in the top right hand corner so after marking all my pieces for the Domino I'm
morticed out all my mortises and I wanted to do a test fit so I inserted
some dominoes you can see they're very tiny five millimeter dominoes because you don't need much this is really just
to hold it in place and then we'll add a few dabs of glue as well once I got the top dry fit with Domino's
I was starting to well not love the way it was looking
it just was a little blah and that's when I remembered when I built the whiskey coffee table I added a
Router Detail
shadow line between the top and the sides to kind of break up that transition so I grabbed a rabbeting bit
I chalked it up in my trim router and I added a eighth inch rabbet around the
entire perimeter of the top and bottom of my drawer box units whenever I do
small router detail like this I always like to run the router in reverse because it makes a cleaner cut it's
technically called a climb cut and because you're pulling the router in the opposite direction of which it is
cutting it's less likely to cause chip out and I really didn't want chip out after I did this much work to get to
this point so just pull it backwards and you'll be surprised how clean of a cut
you get after cutting my rabbet I grabbed a little piece of scrap wood and set it on top so that you can see what
I'm talking about when I say shadow line so instead of the sides going right into the top now it's broken up by an
intentional line that is uniformed and it'll just create a nicer seam
but what wouldn't be nice is trying to get finish in that shadow line after everything's assembled so before I glued
the top and bottom on I decided to pre-finish that shadow line with a little Rubio monocoat next it was time
to insert my dominoes this time with a little bit of glue a tap tap tap a
taparuski speed it up so you don't have to wait so long and we're ready to put
on the top luckily the top slid right on no real hiccups there and I flipped the whole
thing over and did the exact same thing to the bottom or the top I've lost track at this point
I guess it doesn't really matter they're identical anyways after getting both pieces hooked
on both sides I added some clamps I probably didn't need the clamps it was a pretty nice friction fit but I figured
what the heck might as well and in no time I had both of my drawer units glued
up once the glue was dry I removed all the clamps and it was time to shape our
top and bottom pieces I mean you didn't think I was just going to leave those all squared off and ugly
did you the nice thing about the round shape of our sides is that we can now use that shape as a router template to
perfectly match our top so I simply chocked up a quarter inch flush trim bit
in my trim router and I just worked my way around the entire outside I did have
to put a little scrap piece in the front because there was nothing for the bearing on the trim router to land on
but that wasn't that big of a deal once I had that in place and clamped so that it couldn't pop out I continued my
routering and things were starting to look pretty clean after I had everything flush trimmed I
put a 16 inch round over in my trim weight no not 16 inch a 16th inch round
over 16 inch would be huge anyways I rounded over all the edges on the top and bottom
and then I finally found Craig so this time I made him sand everything
while Craig sanded I started working on the internal components meaning the
drawer boxes and the drawer faces I'm going to be using Blum under mount drawer slides so I just set them in
place and I got my measurements for my drawer boxes for the drawer faces I just cut some
simple rectangles of Walnut nothing too fancy while I was sanding those down Craig brought me ice cream
what a nice guy he's always so considerate bringing me stuff while I sand I mean say what you will about the
guy but every once in a while he just does something really sweet anyways back to work
after I cut and sanded down the drawer faces I made some drawer boxes now if I
had more time I would have liked to do something fancy to more match the desk but I just did Baltic Birch with Walnut
veneer bottoms Craig you're just gonna have to live with it
speaking of Craig he was hard at work putting Rubio on all the pieces that I
just built that was until he had to leave to go to
his son's baseball game and somehow I wound up alone in the shop late at night
finishing all the parts and pieces for his desk and when I mean all the parts and pieces
I mean everything including drawer boxes which are a royal pain to put finish on
so thanks a lot Craig but the next morning Craig magically
Assembly
showed up for the fun part assembling all the pieces together and finishing
the desk so first I wanted to add some feet to the bottom of each one of the legs now
this step isn't necessary but it does help avoid any chips that might be
caused to the legs as you you know scoot the desk around so I like these little metal feet you
just nail them into the bottom so after pre-drilling I just add a dab of CA glue
into that hole I start my foot into the hole and tap it in place with a hammer
now gravity is going to hold it in place more than anything else but the CA glue
will ensure that it doesn't pop out once we had a nice stainless steel foot on
the bottom of each one of the legs it was finally time to install these pesky
drawer boxes now believe it or not this is the first time that I'm actually sliding them into
place and part of me was a little concerned that they weren't gonna fit and I was worried about nothing because
they slid in perfectly I guess that's what you get when you use
a tape measure at least that's what you hopefully get like one out of every 20
times and this just happened to be my lucky time next I used a half inch setup block to set the reveals on the front
and the back of the desk and get the drawer boxes into the correct position now I didn't want to just screw the
drawer boxes to the desk frame because I was a little concerned with wood movement so I drilled a large hole and
when I say large it was like a quarter of an inch maybe 3 8 but not huge
through the drawer box just to the desk frame then I drilled a pilot hole in the
center of that larger hole and then I inserted these cabinet head screws now
the screws are much skinnier than the hole so although they'll hold the drawer box
tight to the desk frame there's a little wiggle room around the shaft of the screw to allow for seasonal wood
movement I did this at the front I did this at the back and I did this at the top and just like that our floating
drawer box things are installed so me and Craig carried the whole desk frame
and drawer units up onto the loft of our office where his desk will permanently
reside then Craig carried in the desktop and plopped it in place
hey I just realized why they call those computers desktops because they sit on
your desktop huh never thought about that before anyways
after measuring to get my overhang all even around all four sides it was time
to install the top to the base for that I'm just using the z-clip Fasteners that you've probably seen me use a hundred
times before in other videos after getting the top screwed on it was
time to install our drawer slides I'm not going to spend too much time on this because you have seen me install these
countless times before yes screw them to the side and make sure
they're all spaced and even and level all that jazz if you really want to know
there's a link up there in the corner to a video and I show you exactly how to install
after I got the slides in place I slid in my drawer boxes and then it was time to attach the drawer faces for this I
just used some setup blocks and playing cards to get all my reveals correct and
a little double sided tape to hold the drawer face in place until I could secure it from the inside
with the drawer faces on it was time for my favorite part which was installing
those handmade wooden drawer poles from the beginning of the video and pretty soon we had one side
completely done and we just had to do the exact same thing to the other side and as you can see those drawer poles go
in the opposite direction because we planned it that way and just like that in only two weeks and
very little help from Craig if I'm being honest he had a desk
well she's done took a while but I'm happy with how it turned out hopefully you guys enjoyed
that you learned something there's just one thing left to do that's go and get Craig and bring him up here and show
them the final project outcome thing
Reveal
so I went and got Craig put a blindfold on him and I was excited to reveal his
desk to him I mean I had spent a lot of time on this it was a labor of love so I
brought him in okay take the blindfold off
did you die I watched you build this whole thing in fact I actually sanded a lot of it I
did a lot of it too I mean it's great you literally you ruined everything man
okay what's that this is your uniform uniform we have uniforms well now that
you have a desk I just figured you know this is gonna go with that so give you a
second to get changed [Music]
