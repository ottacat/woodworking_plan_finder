remember last video when we made these sweet doors well yeah in this video I'm gonna make the rest of the cabinet so
enjoy that but I also wanted to take this moment to tell you to remember when we went to England and we built a bed in
that guy's shop slash shed anyways that was because he was the winner of our patreon contest
last year well we're doing our next patreon contest right now you can enter over on patreon you got to be a top tier
Patron and you can enter and if you win well then I'll come out to your shop and we'll build a project together and do a
video so if you want to do that there's a link down there go sign up most importantly enjoy the video
I'm still here I'm just behind the door [Music]
all right so last week we made some doors and now we gotta make the cabinet I know that's a little backwards but
that's how we're doing it so get off my back first thing we needed to do was select a
nice straight long piece of Rift sawn White Oak this is going to be the entire
perimeter of our cabinet but how big are we making the cabinet you might ask well
for making it however big we need to make it so that these doors fit on it because as ifore mentioned the doors are
already made so I take the doors and I set them on my outfeed table and I stick a 16 inch spacer on the top and bottom
because I'm going to want a 16 inch Gap in the middle so the doors can open properly once I have the spacer in place
I measure left to right on the top and on the bottom make sure that it's
consistent and of course I measure up and down this will give us the width and
height that our cabinet box needs to be and the depth will be however deep it
needs to be to hold a bottle of whiskey I suppose now we're going to take this board and we're going to fold it into a
box because I want continuous grain match on three of the four corners you
can't do four of the Four Corners because you know a board can't connect with itself when you finish the Square
anyways so I Mark out my separate pieces because before I can do all of this I'm
gonna have to Mill up this board and get it very nice and square because if I
want my box to be square my wood needs to be square so I Mark out my pieces and I leave about an eighth inch length on
each one of my pieces so I have some room to work with and cut my miters then I go over to the Joiner and I face joint
them and I Edge joint them getting a nice flat surface on one side and a
straight edge on the other and then I cut each board to width which will actually be the depth of my cabinet five
and a half inches with all my pieces cut to width and milled on three of the four sides I next
need to remark them on the end of each piece because now I'm going to go over to the planer and I'm going to plane
them all down to the right thickness and well I would have planed off all my markings and I would have been guessing
trying to get them back into the correct orientation to get all my grain to match with them playing down to right at three
quarters of an inch I start cutting my miters first I start by cutting a miter on one side a perfect 45 degree angle
after I have that cut on one side I measure out the width of my cabinet and I mark it on the board and then I set up
a stop block so that I can repeat this cut on my next board and get two boards
that are exactly the same length that's very important when you're making a box
two sides have to be equal to each other and the top and bottom have to be equal to each other or else you don't get a
box you get like a rhombus or a parallelogram or something weird like that anyways after cutting all of my
miters on all four of my pieces I lay them out just to double check and make
sure that everything's the right size and shape that it should be after I get
all four pieces lined up and it's looking pretty good next I can take my cabinet doors and set them on top and
just double check that this cabinet box will indeed be the right size for these
pre-made cabinet doors gosh I hope they are because if they're not it's not
going to be easy peasy lemon squeezy it's gonna be sad depressed lemon zest
and nobody wants that hey but what do you know they're exactly the right size
I would say I nailed it on the first try and didn't have to make small incremental trims until it was perfect
but this is a YouTube video and you'll believe whatever I show you so let's just say I did it perfect on the first
try next I just scribble on the top of my box this is gonna identify that side
as the front of the cabinet this is important when I Orient all the pieces next I Mark out for a Groove that's
going to be on the back side of the cabinet and house an internal floating panel so I set my fence a half inch away
from my blade and I lower my blade to a quarter of an inch I want a half inch of room on the back of the cabinet because
I'm going to put a French cleat back there that I'll use to hang the whole cabinet off the wall so I run each piece
through the table saw twice to bring it up to a quarter of an inch Groove and I test fit a little scrap piece of quarter
inch ply see look a Groove around the entire thing
next I need to Mark out for my dados I'm going to be cutting dados on my sides as
well as my top and bottom to hold my shelf in the middle and some nice cup
storage that's going to go from the bottom all the way to the top so on my side pieces I just need to put a dado in
the dead center of each piece but on my top and bottom piece I need
two dados because there's going to be two divider things that make up the
Shelf storage so I have to do the math and figure out where I want those to land math sucks but sometimes you just have
to do it next I set up my dado saw to cut a Groove that is the exact width of
some Walnut that I already milled up and we'll be using for all my internal dividers once I have a nice tight fit
into my test piece I'm ready to cut that dado slot in my actual cabinet frame
pieces so I line up my saw using my Rockler Crosscut sled which I absolutely
love for my dado saw it works great especially in combination with the J cats Moses stop block and then I start
cutting dados like nobody's business well it's my business technically this
is literally my business it's how I make money but that's none of your business
well actually it is it absolutely is your business that's why I post these videos and show you so it's both my
business and your business long story short I just started cutting all the dados in my side pieces as well as my
top and bottom pieces until now my cabinet frame looked like this I got a mitered box I got that Groove for my
floating panel and now I have the dados cut for my cup storage and I got the dado cut for my shelf that'll be an
internal divider it'll be whiskey storage on the top and bottom there's just one more thing we have to do before
we glue this up I decided I was going to use these brass rods as kind of a little
safety net so the bottles of whiskey wouldn't fall off the shelves so I Mark
out where I need to pre-drill to insert those brass rods because I won't be able to do it after I glue this whole thing
up so I Mark out for those holes on one side and I Mark out for the holes on the
other side then to make drilling them out a lot easier I use this spring-loaded punch that you've seen
before also available on my website for purchase to just pre-mark all my holes
so that I can get my drill bits seated seated Citadel seated right where I want
it then I drill a 3 8 inch hole into the side of my panels both on the top and
bottom and I drilled this pretty deep it was 3 8 inch in diameter but it was 5 8 of an inch deep because I need to be
able to shove that brass Rod way in there that'll make more sense here in a little bit don't worry I'll explain then
finally I just needed to cut down my Oak plywood for my floating panel and sand
all the insides of all my pieces so that I don't have to worry about sanding
after it's assembled because that would suck now whenever you're gluing up a mitered box like this
it can be a royal pain because there's no good place to get clamps on those mitered Corners that's why I always make
plywood calls and I just glue them on with a little CA glue the nice thing about Plywood And CA glue is it holds
plenty strong to get some clamps on there but the plywood is very easy to just knock off when you're all done and
it won't damage your wood nobody wants there would to be damaged
ouch so with plywood calls glued firmly on all four of our Corners I can start
gluing up my box with that floating panel in the middle now for these miter joints I'm just
using type on too that's it because I'm going to come back after the glue is all
dry and add splines to each one of these Corners the splines will add a ton of
strength to that joint as well as give us an option to you know strut our
creative flare is that a coherent sentence
direct our Creative Flair that doesn't make much sense but
I don't care between the calls and these woodpecker clamping squares this glue up
was a breeze and with that I was ready to move on to getting my splines prepped
so that I could you know add those when the time came now our cabinet doors are
made up of a combination of Walnut White Oak and an orange backer we're already building the cabinet out of white oak so
I thought the splines would look really spiffy if they were Walnut and orange so
I got on Amazon and I bought a sheet of this orange acrylic and my idea is to
wedge it in between two pieces of Walnut to give this cool layered effect kind of
like a walnut and orange acrylic Oreo cookie something along the lines of this
I thought it would really tie the whole vibe together but before I could glue these three
things together I needed to abrade the surface of the acrylic let's scuff it up make it so that the
glue would have a better chance of adhering to it speaking of glue I'll be using thick So Fast cure from Total bow
baby because total boat's the best and this stuff's insanely easy to use it mixes in the tip
you just gotta spread it out and voila instant bond
James Bond sorry walked into that one after getting thick
so spread on one side of my acrylic I spread some more thick so on the other
side and I sandwiched that beautiful orange plastic in between two even more
beautiful pieces of black walnut then I just clamped the whole thing
together and waited patiently for it to dry who am I kidding I'm not patient at all
and I'm definitely not going to stand around and wait for this to dry so back to the Box
while we waited for our splines to dry and our cabinet box was still in clamps
I figured I could start working on our internal dividers so I measured how wide
they needed to be to fit inside of our box and I started cutting up my black walnut the first piece I cut was going
to be the shelf that separates the top from the bottom
usually kind of what shelves do I got it measured and cut so it perfectly fit into our dadoed slots next I'm going to
cut the two divider pieces that are going to go from the top to the bottom and make up our cup storage rack now you
might be thinking to yourself that doesn't look like a cup storage rack well I'm not done yet you ninny so just
hold your horses now because our Shelf is going to bisect our cup storage rack
we're gonna have to employ the use of some half lap joinery so everything fits together
so I Mark out exactly where our Shelf is going to bisect our cup storage and I
cut halfway through the board the exact width of the board itself did you get
that halfway through the board in the exact width of the Shelf itself this
should allow it to half lap over our cup storage which I also cut halfway through
the exact width of the Shelf itself like this
nice and clean like James Dean who is not claimed by the way
he's dead so he's probably all icky too soon
as you can see with all of our half laps cut our Shelf now fits nice and nested
into our cup storage rack thing oh but
we're not done yet oh No in fact we are just getting started
but you are gonna have to wait what are you doing man oh hey
I'm just designing a website um you have a piece of paper tape to
your laptop and you're just drawn on it with a sharpie I'm not a web designer
Jason this is literally the only thing I know how to do why don't you just go to Squarespace it's an all-in-one web
design platform anybody can make a website it's easy yeah but what if I don't want it to just
look good on the computer what if I want it to look good on mobile too literally all their websites are mobile
friendly so if you design it for the computer it's going to look just as good on your phone
yeah but what about adding product because right now I can just add product right here and it seems
pretty easy you're taping things to your computer
I don't even understand how that makes any sense you can literally create an online store in Squarespace and sell
whatever you want it doesn't matter if they're physical products like this sweet Swagger over here or digital
products you can just upload them and sell as many as you want
here's a stumper for you what if I want my name to be the thing that you type in the little rectangle at the top with all
those Woos in front of it you mean a domain name with a www in
front of it yeah you can easily buy those right through Squarespace and it's simple because there's no hidden fees
and they sell over 200 top level domains so you can get one that says.com or dot net or dot org or you can even get more
specific and get one that says dot art do it right on there huh so you're
saying I could design a professional looking website and I don't have to know what I'm doing
and I don't have to draw on my computer screen yeah well I think that's very obvious
that's exactly what I'm saying here's what you do go to squarespace.com and sign up for a free trial and when you're
ready to launch your website go to squarespace.com bourbonmoth woodworking get 10 off your first purchase of a
website or domain like and peel it paper off your screen first or you're
not gonna be able to see the website gosh now that I knew all my half laps fit together the way that
they needed to and all of that stuff fit back into the cabinet the way that it needed to well it was time to break it
all down and cut some more dados because we're not done cutting datas yet
so after taking out my cup storage pieces I marked on those for some more
dados so that I can create some more cup storage and get you off my back about
the fact that it doesn't look like cup storage yet but after this it will well actually there's like 10 more steps
before it will but this is one step closer so I cut one dado on the top and
one dado on the bottom of both cup divider piece thingama Watsons oh and
then remember way back when when we drilled holes in the sides of our cabinet for those brass rods well yeah
we got to drill some holes in the sides of these for those same brass rods
speaking of which here are said brass rods now you're probably wondering how the heck am I going to get the brass
rods in between these two pieces of wood well that's why I drilled that hole in the Oaks so deep first I take the brass
rod and I shove it all the way into that pre-drilled hole on the Oak Side and then I Mark where it hits the Walnut
divider and then I cut it to that length on my metal chop saw
you know closing my eyes very tightly because I'm not wearing safety glasses because that's how the professionals do
it after I get four rods cut to that length I polish them up a little bit with some steel wool and now it's time
to glue in all my internal divider pieces so first I start with the Shelf
divider with the half laps facing up not down because if they're facing down well
that would be a problem because I wouldn't be able to get those other pieces in there so I just add a little glue into my dado slots and I lightly
tap it in place with a rubber mallet as you can see it is a very nice friction fit
tight but not too tight is just right now it's time to put in our cup storage
dividers so I add some more glue to those dadoed slots and this is where we
do things a little different next I mix up some five minute total boat epoxy and
I insert it both into the holes on my shelf divider that's going to house that
brass Rod as well as into the holes on the White Oak then I take the brass rod
and I shove it all the way into that hole all the way and I do the same thing up top here a
little five minute epoxy and I shoved the brass Rod all the way in there now because I measured I can insert this
Walnut divider and it's not running into that brass rot and because we drilled the hole so deep in the white oak once
we get this Walnut divider seated we can pull that brass Rod out of that hole just a little bit and into the
corresponding hole on the Walnut just like this but obviously we want it to
stay there and not fall back out hence the five minute epoxy that's going to hold it nice and tight
in five minutes and I do the exact same thing to the
other side inserting my second cup divider piece and sliding my brass rods
into their necessary circular mounting indentations
also known as holes once this epoxy dries those brass rods
will not be coming back out so make sure your holes are drilled in the right spot and they're exactly where you want them
then to all you haters out there that were like this doesn't look like a cup storage device blue blue which probably
was none of you I kind of just made up that dialogue of my own and have been holding it against you this entire video
anyways now look I add those other internal dividers within my cup storage
and boom cup storage and not just any cup storage
you can hold four glasses in there and that's three more than you even need so
you only have to wash dishes once every four days which is pretty awesome
with that all of the parts of our cabinet are assembled so we can Bonk off
these calls and start sanding everything smooth Bonk technical term for removing calls
so reluctantly I then sanded the entire thing just you know quick once over get
rid of all the fibrous left behinds from our plywood calls and the such and we
were ready to start working on our splines remember when we glued up this bad boy man didn't get a lot done while
you're waiting for glue to dry which it is wonderful so with our blank out of
clamps I go over to the Joiner and I get a nice straight edge on one side and reveal what these glorious splines are
going to look like then I go over to the table saw and I cut them down into uniform strips
that I will use to cut up into smaller uniform strips which I will then use for
splines now to cut the groove for our splines we're not going to use a regular spline
jig we need a monster spline jig so I made this one out of scrap plywood it's
got an arm that rides on top of my table saw fence to keep it nice and aligned and it's basically just a big 45 degree
angle that I can set the entire cabinet in and cut some uniform slots into so I
raised the blade up as high as I can raise it without it coming out the inside of my cabinet and oh boy I'm not
gonna lie I was pretty excited to cut these because well this looks ridiculous
and I knew it was going to be a ton of fun so I just started running this
entire cabinet through the dado saw now the splines I made are pretty big so I
decided two was gonna be plenty per corner so I backed them off about an inch from each Edge and the way I make
sure that they're all even is I run every single Corner through with the cabinet facing out towards you guys and
then when I'm done I flip it around and I run every single Corner through with the cabinet facing the opposite
direction this makes sure I have perfectly evenly spaced it's spline
slots as you can see next it was time to glue those bad boys into place so I squirted
out some total boat thick so and I mixed it with some walnut dust this is just going to help hide the glue should there
be the odd Gap here or there and it'll also help fill any voids that you know
might have been caused by I don't know this is probably not necessary you could
just use regular glue as long as your splines are nice and tight which these are so I just like mixing Walnut and thick so
because it looks like brownie batter and it's fun anyways I just kept working my way
around sticking splines and thick so in every corner until finally I ran out of
corners and with that I decided to let those dry up and start working on mounting my
cabinet doors the project that got us into this whole cabinet mess in the first place
now I decided that regular Euro style cabinet hinges would look a little goofy
on a nice whiskey cabinet like this so I went with classic butt hinges in brass
because they'll match the brass Rod inside the cabinet and then I can put some brass hardware on the doors and
it'll all flow together so with the combination of my pocket
knife and a router and a chisel I mortised out little slots so that the
butt hinges would perfectly be flush with the cabinet door just like this this work can be a little
tedious and there's definitely a reason that not very many people use this style of hinges anymore well there's just not
a lot of room for air you gotta get the mortise perfect and once it's in there the adjustability is
non-existent so if you're going to use hinges like these just make sure to really take your time and get your
measurements exactly right before you start cutting your mortises next I needed to screw the hinges to the
cabinet doors but I had to pre-drill them first luckily I have these self-centering drill bits from Rockler
that are made exactly for this purpose and they perfectly Center the hole right
in the middle of the hole on the hinge which is super important especially with hinges like this because as I mentioned
there's not really any adjustability so you don't want to accidentally drill a hole off center and have it pull your
whole hinge out of whack so I'm telling you just buy these Rockler self-centering drill bits because
they're worth their weight in gold after I got my hinges mounted in my cabinet
doors I set my cabinet doors on top of my cabinet box and I marked out where the hinges need to
on the cabinet box itself then I just repeated the same step I did on the
cabinet doors I traced the hinge with my pocket knife to score the wood I took out most of the material with the router
and I cleaned it up by hand with the Chisel until I had a nice tight fit on
every single one of my hinges then it was back to the Rockler self-centering drill bit and driver and I attached all
the hinges to the cabinet box and then reattached them to the cabinet door
and boom goes the Flippin Dynamite doors installed and I didn't even screw them
up so 0.1 for Jason with my doors installed I uninstalled
them and it was finally time to flush cut our splines and get a look for the
first time at oh man that looks terrible oh don't worry I haven't sanded it yet
it's gonna look way better just you wait so after flush cutting all my splines I
pulled out the sander and a Zip Zap Zoop that's usually what I say for saws but I
haven't said it for a while and I've been jonesing for it oh those look
pretty nice with the orange in there yeah at this point I was so excited I
just couldn't help myself I had to load up the thing with some alcohol and see what it looked like you know just for
fun just what I had laying around the shop and look at that oh
nice and I also couldn't help myself and I wanted to put the doors back on even
though I'm gonna have to take them right back off because I'm not done with this thing yet but sometimes you just want to
see what it's gonna look like and it's looking pretty good
next now there's one concern I had with these hinges there's no spring in them
or mechanism to hold them firmly shut so I thought it might be a good idea to add some magnets both on the cabinet and the
inside of the door so that when you shut the doors they clip and stay shut now these aren't just any magnets these are
n52 and a bunch of other fancy scientific names after that that I don't
understand the meaning of but they are the strongest magnets available in their
size and when I say strong I mean they are ridiculously strong and you can't
buy them on Amazon but you know where you can buy them is on my website because I have a special hookup so
believe me if you buy these you will be like holy cow he wasn't lying these are
the strongest magnets I have ever used in my life like I had to set him that
far away from the other magnet while I was working on them because they kept wanting to hook together because they're crazy strong anyways I
drilled out some holes in the cabinet doors and I drilled out the holes on the cabinets and I added a little bit of CA
glue and I pounded these magnets in place but it was such a tight friction fit that I almost didn't need the glue
but What's It Gonna Hurt then the one final thing I had to take
care of was adding the French cleat to the back of my cabinet if you're not familiar with a French cleat it's a
board with a 45 degree angle cut on one end and then you hang another board with a 45 degree angle up on the wall and
when you hang the cabinet on the wall it marries to that other 45 degree angle and it hangs off of it like a cleat so
to install this I just added a bunch of glue to this Walnut French cleat and I clamped it onto the back and yes that
will be plenty strong to hold up this entire cabinet believe me
now it was time to add finish to this entire thing which I was not looking forward to until
I realized that oh you know what I could just make Craig add finish to it I mean
I don't have to be the one to put the finish on I built the whole thing it's time for somebody else to do a little
work for once am I right so Craig was very happy and willing to grab some
Rubio monocoat Walnut and start applying it to every inch of this whiskey cabinet
I mean he basically begged me to let him put finish on it so
I kindly obliged don't worry I didn't make him do the
entire thing well Craig did the doors I put finish on the actual cabinet box
itself which meant that I was the one that got to put finish on these splines
and make them pop out well not not make them pop out I mean the splines didn't
come out the color of the splines popped
when I put the finish on it really wow
as you can see here he might be saying hey Jason you idiot
you forgot to put finish on the back panel well no I didn't I have a separate
little surprise for right there I'm gonna add some mirrors but not just
any mirrors I'm going to use these acrylic mirrors because they're bendy and you can cut them on your table saw
at least you can if you don't have a saw stop I actually tripped the break on my
saw stop because the static that built up cutting this acrylic I mean I could
have put it in bypass mode but it didn't and now I'm gonna have to change the cartridge but anyways you can cut it on
a normal table saw next I just spritzed a little more thick so onto the back of
my panel you don't need a lot because that thick so is thick yo
and I slid my pre-cut acrylic near pieces into place now I've never used
these acrylic mirrors so I have no clue if they're going to look good or not I'm taking a big gamble here after putting
all this work in but oh they actually look identical to regular mirrors
literally you would not be able to tell the difference if I hadn't shown you
that they weren't real glass and because they were acrylic you get
the fun part of peeling this plastic off it's like unwrapping a present every
time you do it I don't know why it's just really satisfying and now the back of the cabinet well it
looks like there is no back of the cabinet because I'm really on the front of the cabinet right here it just looks
like I'm on the back because mirrors with our mirrors installed I was ready
to put the doors on for the final time and as you can see those magnets are
doing their job and clicking those doors shut I love it when a plan comes together did I mention those magnets are
for sale on my website www.berbandmoth.com after getting my doors installed I installed this brass
hardware I got from Rejuvenation because I know you're going to ask and I filled
the entire cabinet up with bourbon you know for not being a very big cabinet it does hold up to 12 bottles which is
pretty good and those four glasses in the middle with that our whiskey cabinet is
complete between the Walnut and oak doors with that orange backer the Walnut and orange
splines the brass man I just really like the way this thing turned out and the
best part well the best part is it's full of bourbon and with that I
could really only think of one appropriate way to end this video all right
foreign
that was a doozy it's a lot of work for a little cabinet but I mean you can't
argue with the results I mean forget about what the cabinet looks like it's full of delicious bourbon so
it's a winner I mean I could have got a cardboard box and stuck bourbon in it and I would have been happy but hopefully you guys enjoyed that video
you learned something and you saw the whole thing be completed you know all that fancy stuff who cares about that
did you go over to patreon and sign up for our patreon contest so that I can
