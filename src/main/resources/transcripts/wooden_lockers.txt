Intro
oh hi recently we put a home gym in our house I mean really it was just a spare
room and we filled it up with a bunch of gym equipment but I got to tell you it's my favorite room in the whole house not
because I'm in there working out all the time but because when it comes to Home Gyms you can't really build anything I
mean you just go to the store and buy that stuff and stick it in there it was the easiest room to do in the entire
house that wasn't tell this last week when my wife was in there and she said that she wanted a bench built for the
gym not a bench that you like work out on but like a bench that you could sit on really she wanted something to go
underneath the TV that's in the gym to hide all the cables and cords and TV components so here I am building
furniture for the home gym and on top of that she said she wanted it to look
Jimmy Jimmy how do you build a piece of furniture that looks Jimmy I built furniture for Bob and Sam and and Alex
once not [Music]
Home Gym
Jim so here it is our home gym and if you know my wife you know anything in
our house has to look well put together so that's what this bench is all about giving her a storage space under the TV
that can hide all this electrical stuff and wireless router and look in her
words Jimmy now we have this old set of lockers next to where the bench is going to go so my initial thought is try and
make it somewhat Locker esque I'm thinking kind of old school like a piece
of furniture you would see in a library or a locker room in the 1950s so I
quickly got on SketchUp and started throwing a design together now I know this doesn't look like much right now
but no the devil's in the detail and I'll make it look more Jimmy as we go along now when I think old school
furniture and not old school is in old school but like old schoolhouse
Furniture I think quarteron White Oak it just seems like that was the popular thing so that's what I started with some
84 quarteron White Oak because pretty much all the lumber I use is Ruffs on
the first thing I had to do was Mill it up to get it nice and square and flat and easy to work with then I cut it up
into bite-sized chunks and I went over to my table saw and I started ripping it into 1 and 1/2 in x 1 and 1/2 in pieces
because when I designed it in SketchUp well that's what I built the entire frame out of so seemed like a good place
to start whenever I'm trying to get Lumber to a very specific Dimension I get it close on the table saw and then I
usually bring it right to that Dimension over on the planer or the drum sander I just find this to be more accurate and I
can get perfect squares that way once I had all my pieces dimensionalized di
dimensionalized dimensionally where I wanted them I started laying out all of my components
for said gym bench this started by setting up a stop block on the miters
saw and cutting a bunch of uniformed pieces to the right height now I want this to be a bench that you can actually
sit on which means I want to make it a standard chair height which is between 19 and 20 in
I started by making my end caps or my frame pieces they're going to look something like
this only I'm going to actually put some joinery in there so that they stay
together to join this whole thing I'm going new school as opposed to the old
school design meaning I'm just going to use the Domino Joiner because it's quick it's easy and it makes a strong joint so
I took a little setup block that was exactly 4 in and I used that to set my stretchers on the bottom and then the
top stretcher I just put flush with the top pieces I marked out where my dominoes needed to go grabbed the Domino
Joiner did a couple patented hip thrusts and I had all my pieces morticed out and
I was ready to insert my dominoes I mean this is what you got to love about the Domino Joiner it really does make
joinery incredibly quick so in no time I had the rough shape of my
two-end cap thing inits now you might be saying but I see three of them there
well that's cuz I also made one for the middle of the bench and if you're wondering how in the world that's going to work well so am I at this point but
we'll deal with that later for now I got to figure out how to float a panel in the middle of these pieces thought about
using the DAT stack on the table saw and then I opted for the router table I just figured it would be a cleaner cut and I
can have a stop datato and not have to run all the way through with that weird AR of the table saw blade anyways I went
over to the router table I chocked up a/ Quin compression bit and I started running my pieces through carving out a
nice4 in by4 in Channel down the center of all of my pieces now the top and
bottom stretchers I was able to just blow right through the entire thing but when it came to my legs I had a stop
before I got past the stretcher location on the bottom or else you'd see that groove on the leg didn't want that to
happen so I just went until I hit the mortise for my dominoes and I knew that was the right place to stop pretty soon I had
all of my parts and pieces hogged out with the groove and this should allow me to eventually insert a panel and make it
look all pretty now lots of times when I'm building furniture for bathroom
vanities that are going to be painted I'll just throw a piece of Quin plywood in for my panels sometimes I'll even do
MDF if I'm painting it but because I'm using quarteron white White Oak for this entire project I knew that a
store-bought piece of veneered white oak plywood just wouldn't match the true Quon stock that I'm building the rest of
the bench out of but I did have this giant piece of quarteron white oak sitting in my lumber rack for I don't
know years at this point and I figured I might as well do the panels at of solid
wood lots of people don't like using solid wood for panels because they're worried about wood movement that's why
plywood is such a popular thing but if you do it right wood movement isn't going to be a problem and I'll show you
how I do it to kind of alleviate that risk so after planing down my Quon piece
to a/4 of an inch yes just sending a ton of material into my dust collection bin
I could have Resa it on the band saw but I don't have time for that nor do I have a tall enough band saw so planing it
down it was and pretty soon I had my panels now the panels did run into the
dominoes so I had to Mark out where the dominoes were so that I could Notch out the panel just a little bit to fit
around those dominoes I mean if I would have done a true shaker style mortise and Tenon I probably could have
alleviated this but a little Notch Notch here and Notch Notch there never hurt anybody it looked something like this
and now it should be able to slide in right next to those dominoes something
like this right here might just get your arm out of the way so that people can see
there you go look at that beautiful Quon panel inside a Quon frame now the trick
Floating Panels
to doing solid wood panels is you have to make them truly floating which means I am not going to glue these panels in
place they're just going to be held in that Groove with no glue and this will allow them to move around that being
said before I install the panels and glue up my frame I have to pre-finish the panel if you don't pre-finish the
panel it might look good when you first put finish on it but as that wood moves you're going to get a nice Halo ring
around the inside of the panel where you didn't get finish on initially and ain't nobody wants that kind of ring it's not
the kind of ring that Beyonce is begging for in all those music videos it's an ugly unfinished ring around your panel
so just pre-finish it and then you don't have to worry about it now some people might insert Space Balls which are these
little rubber balls to secure the panel and keep it from wiggling and rocking but I found as long as you get a nice
tight friction fit you're not going to get any rocking or wiggling so I mean I
guess if you want to be lazy and make your Cuts really loose and wonky then
yeah use space balls so it doesn't rock around or you could just take the time to get a good fit and not worry about it
Making the Bench
the choice is yours at this point I had three dividers all glued up with those
pre-finished panels now to somehow connect them into a a a bench a seat a
Jimmy thing now I had previously taken measurements on the gym wall using my
arms stretched out as far as they could go now I'm 6 ft tall so I know that my arm span is roughly 6 ft so I decided to
make my bench 6 ft long it seemed appropriate don't laugh at me for not
using a tape measure arms are just as good so I cut some stretcher pieces to
go between my two outside panels that would make the over length of the bench 6 ft and I started marking out those
stretchers for dominoes to be morti on those two outside panels notice I'm not
dealing with that Center panel yet because I still haven't exactly decided
how I'm going to hook that all together but again we'll get to that in a little bit I pulled out the Domino Joiner I did
a few more classic patented hip thrusts to mortise out all my mortises and I did
the same thing on my side panels unfortunately this was up on the table so the hip thrust didn't work believe me
I tried and well I'm going to have to ice my neede lator it took a pretty bad
spill with all my mortises morti I was able to dry fit my bench together using
my 6t span as a clamp as you can see I should have made it just a little skinnier because that is right at the
very end of my reach maybe this is why I use a tape measure or just grab a clamp off the wall you
Cutting the Half Flaps
don't have to use your hands but I got it together in the end now for this Old
Chestnut how do you get this panel to sit in the middle without using dominoes
because it's the same width as your outside panels and that's when it hit me my Uncle Dan always says when you can't
Z or zap you better half laap so that's what I decided to do just do some half
half flap joints in the middle of the stretchers and then do corresponding half flap joints on that middle panel
and the whole thing will just right into place so I marked out on my top and
bottom stretchers where I needed to cut those half flaps and the plan was just to disassemble the whole thing and take
my stretchers over to the D saw and carve them out so with all of my half
flaps marked out as you can see I like to scribble the amount of material I need to remove just so I don't make any
mistakes I did the same thing on my middle panel on the top and kind of
middle esque area down there and with everything marked out it was over to the
DAT saw to start cutting now the last thing you want in your life is a Loosey
Goosey half flap so it's best to take your time and go slow that's why I have
a very skinny Doo stack in the saw so I can really creep up on my Dimension you
you can always take more off but she can't always put more on that's not true
actually this is woodworking you can always glue more on it just takes longer and you kind of got to backtrack a
little bit so like I said it's best to just go slow pretty soon I had the half
laps cut on my middle divider piece and I carried it over just to kind of make sure everything was lined up correct
then I disassembled my dry fit bench took those stretcher pieces made sure my
marks were all nice and clear and it was back over to the DAT saw to very slowly
creep up on those pencil lines a little bit here a little bit there and we were
Assembly
hopefully ready to reassemble this now this is where things are going to start to get a little tricky because now
instead of two panels I'm dealing with three one of them half lapped two of them dominoed so getting this together
was going to be a doozy not to mention I cut those half laps fairly tight so I
can't just push them together they're going to require a little Mallet work so
yeah we'll see if I get through this whole thing without dropping something on the floor I started out by doing an
end panel inserting that middle panel getting those half laps locked in place on the lower stretchers and then I moved
to the upper stretchers I just figured this would be the easiest order of operations because once I had those two
pieces done I could just kind of slide on that end cap and I was very happy to see that it all
worked and came together very nicely we are well on our way to making a bench
unfortunately if you tried to sit on this bench at this point I think your butt would get stuck in that giant hole
in the top so before I get too much farther I decided to make a top for the
bench I had some other Quon pieces laying around so I M them all up to make
them look pretty and then I glued them together to create my bench top I didn't
have one piece wide enough so I had to do three pieces glued together but that's fine just a light bead of glue in
each seam I didn't put any dominoes or biscuits in there because well you just
don't need them so once I got the entire thing in clamps I hit it with a hammer
to get my seams lined up because I didn't use any dominoes or biscuits so my seams weren't lined up anyways while
I waited for that to dry I needed to add some dividers between my top and bottom stretchers on the front of the bench to
create little Bays or Cubbies that will become our storage compartments as the
bench build progresses I don't know why I went all NPR there for a second that's not how I
talk anyways I cut some pieces of wood and I shoved them in the voids
Tada now that I had those where they needed to go I pulled them out and once
Reassembly
again back to that good old hip Thruster ruski to mortise out some holes and then
I had to De assemble the entire bench again so I could add mortises to those stretchers then I could insert those
dividers and very carefully try and wiggle this whole Contraption back into
place again I wonder how many times on average I assemble and disassemble a
single piece of furniture while I'm making it I mean it's got to be quite a lot you take it apart you put it
together you put it together you take it apart I'm going to be honest with you guys this whole furniture making thing
is a lot of work if only there was some big like store you could go to that just
had Furniture there already made that would be nice that's a million-dollar idea right there before I
could find another excuse to take this entire thing apart and put it back together I decided I better just glue
the whole thing together so I wouldn't have the option to take it back apart so very carefully Domino by Domino I worked
my way down the line gluing all the dominoes in place and trying not to put
anything back together in the wrong order I'm 85% sure I got it together
correctly the hardest part was this internal divider because I basically had
to get that seated first and then build the rest on the outside so it was kind of like this giant teeter totter while I
was doing the glue up until I got one end cap on but it all came together
mostly stress-free I mean it is nice to be beating something with a hammer the
entire time because any stress you get immediately just floats away with every
pound of the Mallet I learned from my previous mistake of trying to use my arms as clamps and I pulled some actual
clamps off the wall to hold everything secure until the glue dried while I
waited for the glue to dry I decided to get to work on my doors or drawer faces
Door Faces
still not exactly sure what they're going to be but I decided to start working on them nonetheless I measured
my openings and realized I had just enough of this giant Quon piece of white
oak left over that I could use that to do continuous grain match across the entire front and make all my door faces
out of single pieces of Oak which is awesome because it means a lot less milling and a lot less gluing things up
so I set up a stop block over on my miter saw to get my drawer faces the exact right Dimension and very carefully
I started working my way down the line making sure to keep track of all of my
pieces so they stayed in the right order the worst is when you mix them up and
then you're trying to guess where the grain goes back together especially with cortison because the grain is so so similar sometimes it gets confusing
that's why before I did anything else I put some pieces of tape on each seam and I marked them so there would be no
confusion now I already mentioned that I kind of wanted to make this look like an old set of lockers so I wanted to do
some sort of grate or vent pattern on the front of each drawer face I experimented around with a few different
pattern options that I did over on the shape or origin and my wife finally picked out this pattern which meant that
is what we're doing no questions no arguments you just do
it so I set up a nice shaper station in the corner with the shaper plate thing
what's it and I created the whole pattern that my wife desired and I started drilling it into each and every
drawer face it actually looks pretty cool and definitely gives that old
school locker vibe that I was looking for ah ah nice now this might have been
one of the few times I wished I had a CNC because that was one panel done
three to go and although the shap or origin makes it much much easier to cut these out it still takes a long time to
drill all of those holes about halfway through I realized my glue was dry so I took off all my clamps so that I could
see the piece a little bit better and I just kept working my way along until
pretty soon all of the doors were drilled at least that's what I thought
and then like I always do I decided to make things way more complicated than
they needed to be I had already ordered these cool little stainless steel Locker plates that I thought would be a nice
Locker Plates
addition but what's better than a locker plate just screwed on the front of a drawer face a locker plate in set on the
front of the drawer face so I took each drawer face back off went over to the
shaper and I carved out a nice little recess that could hold each and every
Locker plate because I just can't help myself but making things ridiculously
detailed when they don't need to be but I will admit it does make it look pretty
cool and I even made them a little bit big so there was a nice little recess border around each plate the next big
question was what to do for drawer poles or cabinet poles or Hardware of any kind
on these faces I really wanted to stay with the locker Vibe so after looking at a lot of pictures of lockers this is
what I came up with I took each face back over to the shaper and I hogged out this set of recesses in the top of each
face you have a lip around the outside and then a deeper recess in the middle no that's not going to be the drawer
pole just wait till I'm done after I recessed that shape out on every single
panel so they looked something like this I milled down some more Cordon Oak to
about a/4 of an inch thick took that back over to the shaper and using that same shape I just cut out but this time
cutting on the outside of the cut instead of the inside I cut out these little ring-shaped pieces once I pry
this up you'll see what I'm talking about they looked something like this now if I did this correctly these should
perfectly fit into that recessed lip on the outside creating a very nice wooden
Locker inspired integrated drawer SL cabinet door pull I haven't decided
which one I'm doing yet so stay tuned for that but as you can see once I got
them all done they look pretty nice all I'll have to do is eventually glue that
little ring in place and ah wooden
lockers by this time my bench top had been in clamps long enough so I
Bench Top
unclamped it and sent it through the planer to knock down all my glue seams
it's always really enjoyable when you can send an entire panel through your planer and you don't have to sand the
whole thing then it was over to my miter saw to cut it to the correct length and I set it on top of the bench to get a
first look oh now you could sit on it without falling through that giant hole
in the top I mean we practically have a bench and there's no bottom on the
inside of the bench or back on it but we're going to take care of that right now I flipped the bench over and I cut
some 3/4 in strips of white oak that I'm going to glue around the entire interior
of this bottom hole to create a lip on the inside that I can set a panel on top
of that doesn't make any sense at all I'm basically just clamping and gluing a bunch of pieces of wood on to create a
shelf to set set my bottom piece on and if that doesn't make any sense at all
well just watch the video I'll show you what I'm talking about eventually while I waited for the glue
to dry on those pieces I poured myself a nice glass of bourbon and unfortunately
it was time to sand down all of my drawer faces and get them ready for finish which also meant that I needed to
Drawer Faces
glue this little integrated pull ring thing in place but before I glued it in
place I wanted to pre-finish that internal cavity because in a move that is very unlike me I actually thought
ahead and realized I would have a doozy of a time getting finish in there after that ring was glued in place so using a
very minimal amount of glue because I really didn't want to deal with squeeze out I very carefully inserted those
pieces into the hole gave them a little tap tap tap arusi with a mallet and a
scrap piece of wood and they were installed about a half an hour and a few
glasses of whiskey later all my drawer faces were sanded my poles were installed and my internal little holes
were oiled up the internal holes on the drawer faces not my internal holes a half an
Foot Chamfer
hour is long enough to take clamps off of something right sure why not while I
had the bench flipped over I decided to add add a little chamfer to the bottom of each one of the feet this is always a
nice choice stylistically but it really helps prevent any chip out on the bottom of those feet as you drag the bench back
and forth across your floors just something to think about when you're building a bench or a table or a chair
bar stool really any piece of wood that comes in contact with the floor it's always a good idea next I had to figure
out how to install the back panel so that the bench wasn't backless it's not
that fancy all right this is like a casual bench it's not a backless sort of
thing my solution was to carve out a rabbit around both back panel sections
with the router bit and then I'm just going to cut a piece of/ Quin veneered Oak plywood and set it in there so after
taking all my measurements I cut a piece of Oak veneered Plywood And I set it in
there actually is a little more complicated than that because as you can see the router leaves these round
corners now you could cut these to a perfect 90 with a chisel do it all by
hand but sometimes you mess up doesn't look super clean and I think it's a lot
easier just to round over your panel to match the already perfectly rounded rabbit if you ask me so I found the
right radius with a little router template that I had in my drawer traced it on there went over to the oscillating
belt sander and just kind of sanded it to my line until it fit and as you can
see you can get a pretty nice tight fit just by sanding those Corners down and
then it kind of looks cool all rounded and retro on the back of a bench that
nobody's ever going to see because it's up against a wall but anyways there's
how I did the back panels now I would normally use a piece of 3/4 in or/ in ply for my bottoms but I
didn't want to buy a full sheet of Oak veneered plywood in 3/4 in and 1/4 in so
I just use my 1/4 in and hid a piece of/ in Birch underneath it no one's going to
know I mean literally every single person who watches this video is now
going to know but other than that if someone just comes in my house they're
not going to know anyways next I needed to add a little tab on the top of each
one of my openings so that the drawer face/ cabinet door I haven't decided
which one yet will have something to land on and stay you know perfectly
inset not go too far inset if you know what I mean so a couple drops of tight
Bond one drop of super glue and I just squeezed it on there and used my old
finger clamps until it dried the next morning I came out to the shop and I was
finally ready to get some finish on this thing which means that for the 28th time
I had to De assemble the entire thing is it de assemble or disassemble I'm
realizing now it's disassemble have I been saying de assemble this whole time like an idiot I had to
disassemble the entire thing and and this might also be a good time to come
clean and admit that when I say I am going to put finish on this what I
really mean is I'm going to make Craig put finish on this I mean look at all
those holes you think I want to meticulously get finish in each and every one of those holes I don't think
so this is exactly why you have employees to do all the stuff that
you're too lazy to do yourself so enjoy Craig while Craig was busy finishing I
Stainless Steel Feet
mean literally he was in the middle of finishing this while I came over and started drilling holes in it I decided
to add some nice stainless steel feet on the bottom of each one of my wooden feet
it's kind of like clip on nails for your hand I mean you already have a hand but
you want something else on it so you're like what else could I put on this hand that already does its job oh I know
something pretty and shiny so I put on those stainless steel feet
it's where my head was at when I was doing it and for all you haters that are like you made Craig do everything I did
put finish on the top myself so I helped a little bit now if you ever spend
countless hours putting together a nice Quon Oak top and sanding it and then
putting finish on it the very next thing you should do is drill a bunch of holes in it just on a whim because you all of
a sudden had idea didn't think through it at all and just went for it because
that's exactly what I did in this case I had these stainless steel carriage bolts laying around the shop and I thought
maybe it would be a nice accent if I added some of those on the benchtop now
before you call me crazy just hear me out if you look at any sort of gym Furniture bleachers locker room benches
I mean they got these carriage bolts on there and I got the stainless steel feet down below
Stainless Steel Plates
so why not put a little stainless steel up top to match and if that's not enough
I also got those stainless steel Locker plates that are going to go on each drawer face SL door haven't decided yet
so the stainless steel theme kind of continues throughout with everything
finished I dropped in my secret Birch panels and I tacked them in place this
actually kind of worked out good because now I can tack the Birch in place and I can just glue the/ Quin panel on top and
cover all those nail holes so after getting the Birch tacked in place just with some 16 gauge brad nails I
schmeared on a little wood glue here or there nothing too crazy you don't need a
lot of holding power and I inserted my now pre-finished Oak veneered 1/4in
panel and with that I could really start to see this thing take shape I had a
nice friction fit on my quarter inch panels so I really didn't need anything to hold them down while I waited for
that glue to dry I just pounded them in with my fist and left them now to the
drawface SL doors I decided why not do sort of a hybrid thing it's not a drawer
but it looks like one but I don't want it to swing like a traditional cabinet door so why not have it fold
straightforward I mean it is going to have electrical components in it there might be a time that you want to just leave the door open or access it easily
so I got on Amazon I found these little hinges that just attached to the bottom and they're springloaded so they hold
the door shut and in place which is kind of nice so I use some playing cards to
wedge my door and its appropriate you know positioning and then I screwed
those hinges in from the back which was really nice that I hadn't installed those panels on the back yet and they
just fold forward I actually think it's kind of cool so I
just slowly worked my way down the line I had the foreman come out just to test
the action on them make sure they were up to his liking which they were and before long I had all
Installing the Top
four doors I'm going with doors installed and it was time to secure the
top now to hook the top on I'm just going to use these Z Fasteners I didn't show it but I pre-drilled some mortises
with the Domino Joiner that those Z Fasteners can slide into and hook the top on then I just had to pop my panels
in the back of the bench and hold on to your seats I just nailed them in place
with the nail gun I know you're cringing right now you're like what you're using a nail gun after you spend all this time
but just track with me for a second if you look at any antique piece of
furniture the back panel is always is just nailed on there I mean sure they
used fancy like antique nails and a hammer but Nails nonetheless so don't
get your britches in a bunch from me using a Pneumatic nail gun when it's pretty much the same thing everybody
else does so take that to your comment section I have to admit when my wife
Final Thoughts
first asked me to build a piece of furniture for our home gym I thought it was kind of silly but once I got started
I actually had a lot lot of fun it was a super interesting challenge to try and create a piece of furniture that looked
somewhat gyes Locker esque old school and still function for what we needed it
to function for and would look good in the space and I'm kind of sad that it's
going to go into a room in the house that I never go into I'm just kidding I go in there
sometimes to watch TV when my wife's watching mag magnolian Network on the
other one and I just need to get away and sometimes I'll even I'll pick up weights and I'll just Clank them
together to make her think I'm in there working out I'll turn the treadmill on and just let it run but I'm just sitting
in the corner drooling eating a bag of Doritos why have a six-pack when you can
have the whole cake hopefully you guys enjoyed that
Squarespace
video a huge thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring the video now let me talk just for a second about Squarespace now
when it came to finding a good platform to design a website on I had a couple requirements number one it had to be
simple to use because I'm not very smart when it comes to computers number two it needed to have a very good app I pretty
much do everything on my iPhone so I wanted to be able to operate and check on my website directly from my phone as
well their app is perfectly integrated with their websites so you can check everything right from your phone like I
just saw that I got an order so I can get on the Squarespace app I can see how much inventory I have left when I need
new products I can use my phone to take pictures of those products and upload those pictures directly to the website
which means I can add new products to the website in a matter of minutes one of my favorite features of the Squarespace app is the analytics button
because this is fun to check and not only see what products I'm selling but see how much products I've sold that
month see where those sales are coming from they have this cool little map and I can look and see everywhere in the
world that we've sold stuff there are also times that I sell products directly to people in person and the nice thing
with the Squarespace app is that I can hook the Square card reader to my phone and it connects with the Squarespace app
so that when I sell things in person it automatically updates the quantity of my items on the Squarespace app so I don't
have to do it manually so if you would like to try Squarespace for yourself you should go to squarespace.com sburban
